# About my first project on Github
This is my mini project
The purpose of this project is to develop an advanced and accurate paddy disease detection system using a combination of machine learning algorithms, specifically a modified Leemurs optimization technique applied to KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors). By leveraging these techniques, we aim to enhance the efficiency and reliability of disease detection in paddy crops, thereby empowering farmers with timely and precise information to effectively manage and mitigate disease outbreaks. Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute towards sustainable agriculture practices, ensuring higher crop yields, reduced economic losses, and improved food security in agricultural communities.
We consider 5 diseases namely rice blast,brown leaf spot, leaf folder, hispa and bacterial leaf blight.
